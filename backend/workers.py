        Act as an expert curriculum designer. Your task is to create a detailed, structured, 8-week learning roadmap for the skill: "{skill_name}".
        The output MUST be a valid JSON object. Do not include any text or markdown formatting before or after the JSON.
        The JSON object should have a single key "weeklyPlan" which is an array of objects.
        Each object in the array represents a week and must have the following keys:
        - "week": (Number) The week number, from 1 to 8.
        - "topic": (String) A concise, clear title for the week's topic.
        - "description": (String) A 2-3 sentence summary of what the learner will cover and achieve this week.
        - "status": (String) The initial status, which must be "PENDING".

        Example for "React.js":
        {{
          "weeklyPlan": [
            {{
              "week": 1,
              "topic": "Fundamentals: JSX, Components & Props",
              "description": "Understand the core concepts of React. Learn how to write UI with JSX, create functional components, and pass data using props.",
              "status": "PENDING"
            }}
          ]
        }}
